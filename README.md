Momento is a mobile application that would allow people to show others their ideas, thoughts, or feelings at a certain location using images and text. Our goal is to give users an open platform to talk to others in the same area and to comment on nearby places and events.

Users will be asked to sign up through email address for the first time they use the app. After creating an account, they will be able to log in by email or a unique username and a safe password they choose.

The homepage is a map with pinpoints representing posts people put up. The user can navigate through the map to access different posts at different locations. For example, users can view pinpoints in Los Angeles and also pinpoints in UCLA by zooming in the map, or the user can pan the map to San Francisco to see what is happening there. These posts will be displayed on the main page for a certain duration of time, before they “timeout.”

The users can also access a menu. The menu includes several options: “All Posts,” “Favorites,” “My Posts,” and “Logout.” “All Posts” lead the user to the main page, whereas “My Posts” lead the user to a page with all of his or her posts ordered from most recent to oldest. “Favorites” page also display the posts the user has favorited. Clicking “Logout” will log out the user and take him to the login page.

Users can write a post or view others’ posts at a certain location. After people posted their status, there will be a pinpoint shown on the map stating the location that can be clicked on to view the content. There will be features to reply and like the posts.

The users will also be able to create posts. They can specify the subject and categories. The post will also offer an option to add images.

There will be a search feature to filter out posts by categories or some key words. Also, the user can search the location to navigation.

Lastly, the users will be able to send feedbacks to the developers. This feature can be used to express the needs or concerns so that the developers can address them as soon as possible.
